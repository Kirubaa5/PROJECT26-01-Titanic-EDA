# ðŸš€ PROJECT 26 - Project 1: Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my **#PROJECT26** challenge â€” 26 projects from beginner to advanced to become a Data Scientist by 2026.  
In **Project 1**, I perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Titanic dataset** to uncover patterns and insights about passengersâ€™ survival.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Titanic dataset contains details of passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived the tragic shipwreck.  
The goal is to explore the data, visualize key patterns, and lay the foundation for predictive modeling.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- **Files used:**
  - `titanic.csv` â€” Passenger data

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation & cleaning  
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** â€“ Statistical plotting  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Interactive coding

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Analysis
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, correcting data types
- Survival rate analysis by:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age group
  - Embarkation port
- Visualization of trends & correlations

## ðŸ“‘ Results & Insights
- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **First-class passengers** were more likely to survive compared to third-class.
- Younger passengers had a slightly higher survival probability.
